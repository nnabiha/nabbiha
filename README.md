- 👋 Hey, I’m @nnabiha,
- 👀 I’m interested in Cloud Native Generative and Agentic AI Engineering.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I skipped computer science in 9th grade as a subject choice and I jumped into the computing world during A levels as a pure Bio student to learn GenEng from scratch. I want to collaborate it with my greatest interest being Islamic sciences, minimalism and wellness in the future.
